# Rusty Embed Fixer Bot
Very simple bot that resends your message that contains tiktok/instagram/twitter link(s) with the embed fixed.

Relies on tnktok, ddinstagram, vxtwitter, and fixvx.

## How to Use
### Prebuilt
For those who don't even know what Rust is, go with this instead!
1. Download this https://github.com/yuvlian/rusty_embed_fixer_bot/releases/download/Release/rusty_embed_fixer_bot.7z
2. Extract the zip
3. Edit config.yml to your actual discord bot token
4. Launch the binary (aka .exe)

   (Yes I know it's named "rusty_tiktok_bot" despite supporting 2 other websites... too lazy to change it.)
6. Bot is online!

### Build from source
I'm sure you already know how if you're planning to build from source
